## 🧭 Overview
Udara bridges the gap between people and financial systems using **speech understanding and intent recognition**.  
Users simply **speak naturally** — “Udara, send ₦5,000 to Tunde” — and Udara securely executes the command through partner APIs.

It combines **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**, and **secure API integrations** to deliver accessible, trusted, and inclusive banking experiences.
